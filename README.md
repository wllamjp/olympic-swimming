# Olympic Swimming Gold Medal Forecasting

## Overview
This project analyzes Olympic swimming results (1912-2020) and tracks the overall progression of the core events in swimming through the century by taking the average of each Olympic year. This project also aims to predict gold medal times for future Olympic games in the same core events.

## Features
- Data Cleaning: Standardizes inconsistent time formats (e.g., "ss.mss", "hh:ss.mssssss", "m:ss.ms", "ss") into a standardized "mm:ss.ms" or "sss.ms" for better calculation
- Trend visualization: Plotting Olympic performance trends over time
- Basic Predictive Modeling: Forecasts future gold medal times for:
    - 100m Freestyle
    - 100m Backstroke
    - 100m Breaststroke
    - 100m Butterfly
    - 200m Individual Medley
